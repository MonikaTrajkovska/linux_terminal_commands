1. Grep command  (‘global regular expression print’. This command is used to search a pattern within a file by processing the text line by line.)
ex. This will wirst search the file than it will search in the file specific word that we will write
echo "enter a filename to search text from"
read fileName
if [[ -f $fileName ]]
then
    echo "enter the text to search"
    read grepvar
    grep -i -n -c -v $grepvar $fileName   (-i is for case sensitive , -c is how many times it show, -v shows all the lines without that specific word
else
    echo "$fileName doesn't exist"
fi

2.awk Command

ex. to print evrything from the file 

echo "enter a filename to print from awk"
read fileName
if [[ -f $fileName ]]
then
    awk '{print}' $fileName         //// awk '/Linux/ {print}' $fileName      this command will print specific word   awk '/Linux/ {print $2}' $fileName will print second word in the line
else
    echo "$fileName doesn't exist"
fi


3.sed (The sed command stands for stream editor, performs editing operations on text coming from standard input or a file. sed edits line-by-line and in a non-interactive way. )
ex.
echo "enter filename to substitute using sed"
read fileName
if [[ -f $fileName ]]
then
    cat filegrep.txt | sed 's/i/I/g'   this will change all i letters in bigger one (I)   cat filegrep.txt | sed 's/i/I/g' > newfile.txt   (all changes of the file will be stored in newFile.txt)
                            's/Linux/Unix/g    this will change word Linux to unix 
else
    echo "$fileName doesn't exist"
fi
