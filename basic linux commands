mkdir -p file1/file2/file3 - pravi tri filderi eden vo drug 
rm -rf file1- gi brise site tri folderi 
 se proveruva so ls -F -vidot na folderot:
 @- deka e link 
 / deka e vo directory 
 * - executable 
 ls -t List files by time
 ls -r Reverse order
 ls -latrLong listing including all filesreverse sorted by time.

ls -l - gives you detailed info about the current directory 
ls -a - shows you hidden files (ex.configuration files) 
ls -la -shows all files (hidden one also ) with all details 
grep button <name of the file> =-- will search for the word button in that file 
diff <name of file> <name of file> -will give the difference between those files 
info <word ex.echo> - gives informations abotu that command 
ls <name of file -copy names on evrything on that directory 
pwd <<name of file -overwite at the end the file 

Permissions
-rw-rw-r--- this is permission in linux which means that this is file
drwxrwxr-x this means that this is folder(directory)
The characters means: 

r = read permission
w = write permission
x = execute permission
- = no permission

The first part of the code is 'rw-'. This suggests that the owner 'Home' can:
Read the file
Write or edit the file

The second part is 'rw-'. It for the user group 'Home' and group-members can:
Read the file
Write or edit the file

The third part is for the world which means any user. It says 'r--'. This means the user can only:
Read the file
Changing permissions 

The various owners are represented as -

User Denotations
u	user/owner
g	group
o	other
a	all
To change permission we use command
*** chmod permissions filename*** ex. chmod o+w Bacon
to remove permission we use - sing .ex chmod o-w Bacon

* chmod 754 Bacon 
We have also numbers that means the same as permissions.Wew have:
4 stands for "read"
2 stands for "write"
1 stands for "execute"
0 sands for "no permissions

We could combine this numbers (permsisions ).No. 7 means that can write, execute,read
but don not forget that 7 is user, 5 is group and 4 is other.So in this ex. user can write,read and execute, group can read and execute and other can only read
sudo chown <username> <filename> change the ownership of the file
sudo chown <username:groupname> <filename> change the ownership of the file to other group 

id -Gn - gives info in which group the user belongs 
groups <name> - gives info in which group the user belongs 
chgrp <name of the group> <file name> changes the group

* Verify files using checksum
When we want to verify the file that we downloaded from net is it the same that we need we use checksum or grep 
ex. number of file1 | grep number of file2
     muber of file1 cksum number of file2
     
* Compress / Extract files
gzip <name of the file> - compress the file
gunzip <name of the file- decompress the file 
When we have many large files and one to compress in one single folder we use 
tar cvf <name.tar> <file1> <file2> ex tar cvf Bucky.tar Pizza Cocacola
* To extract from folder that is compress we use 
tar xvf <name.tar> ex tar xvf Bucky.tar 

*Install software with apt get 
sudo apt-get install java - we install java or other software
to run that(shell script) we use
bash java.sh

*Users 
sudo useradd ading user ex sudo useradd Eva 
sudo userdel name-deliting user
cat /etc/passwd- listing all users
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -c "test user" test - "m" create home folder for the user , "s" will tell what will be using the user (shell) , "c" stands for message and at the end is the username
sudo passwd name changes the pass of the user
su name - login as that user 
exit - to exit as that user 
cat /etc/group list all the groups 
sudo usermod -aG sudo test-  ** a is for adding group membership. This means leave all membership how they are and add this hew membership 

Create a group and membership
sudo addgroup name  add new group
sudo usermod -aG <nameofthegroup> <nameoftheuser> add that user to the group we specify 
sudo groupdel name delete the group
Attribute of files
lsattr- list files attribute 
sudo chattr  +i name of the file = this makes files imutable ,we cannot change it (to write in it)
sudo nano <filename> we can edit directly on the file 
head <filename> gives first 10 lines of the file
head -2 <filename> gives the first 2 lines in the file 
tail <filename> gives last 10 lines of the file
last -2 <filename> gives the last 2 lines in the file 

***file system*** 
ext4
stat <filename> tells evrything about the file including inode number 
sync     forces all data in cache to be written on the disk
sudo fsck  check siystem integrity 
sudo tune2fs -m 0 <path of the drive>  to tweak filesystem parametars and adjust reserved space for the system 
e4defrag to defragment the filesystem
