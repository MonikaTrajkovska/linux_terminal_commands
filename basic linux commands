ls -l - gives you detailed info about the current directory

grep button <name of the file> =-- will search for the word button in that file 
diff <name of file> <name of file> -will give the difference between those files

Permissions
-rw-rw-r--- this is permission in linux which means that this is file
drwxrwxr-x this means that this is folder(directory)
The characters means: 

r = read permission
w = write permission
x = execute permission
- = no permission

The first part of the code is 'rw-'. This suggests that the owner 'Home' can:
Read the file
Write or edit the file

The second part is 'rw-'. It for the user group 'Home' and group-members can:
Read the file
Write or edit the file

The third part is for the world which means any user. It says 'r--'. This means the user can only:
Read the file
Changing permissions 

The various owners are represented as -

User Denotations
u	user/owner
g	group
o	other
a	all
To change permission we use command
*** chmod permissions filename*** ex. chmod o+w Bacon
to remove permission we use - sing .ex chmod o-w Bacon

* chmod 754 Bacon 
We have also numbers that means the same as permissions.Wew have:
4 stands for "read"
2 stands for "write"
1 stands for "execute"
0 sands for "no permissions

We could combine this numbers (permsisions ).No. 7 means that can write, execute,read
but don not forget that 7 is user, 5 is group and 4 is other.So in this ex. user can write,read and execute, group can read and execute and other can only read

* Verify files using checksum
When we want to verify the file that we downloaded from net is it the same that we need we use checksum or grep 
ex. number of file1 | grep number of file2
     muber of file1 cksum number of file2
     
* Compress / Extract files
gzip <name of the file> - compress the file
gunzip <name of the file- decompress the file 
When we have many large files and one to compress in one single folder we use 
tar cvf <name.tar> <file1> <file2> ex tar cvf Bucky.tar Pizza Cocacola
* To extract from folder that is compress we use 
tar xvf <name.tar> ex tar xvf Bucky.tar 

*Install software with apt get 
sudo apt-get install java - we install java or other software
to run that(shell script) we use
bash java.sh

*Users 
sudo useradd ading user ex sudo useradd Eva 
sudo userdel name-deliting user
cat etc/passwd- listing all users
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -c "test user" test - "m" create home folder for the user , "s" will tell what will be using the user (shell) , "m
